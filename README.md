# 📊 CodeSentinel_DataAnalytics-Task3

## 🧠 Task Overview
For this task, I developed a Python-based data visualization and analysis script to generate insightful plots and charts from structured data (e.g., sales or customer data). The script leverages various visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create graphs like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. These visualizations help in understanding the relationships between different variables and uncovering trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset.

This task is essential for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and enables analysts to interpret data visually before applying advanced machine learning or predictive modeling techniques.

## 📊 Key Visualizations Generated

- **Histograms** → Visualizes the distribution of numerical variables and helps in understanding their spread and skewness.
- **Box Plots** → Identifies outliers and visualizes the spread of data across different categories.
- **Scatter Plots** → Displays relationships between two continuous variables, highlighting any potential correlations.
- **Correlation Matrix** → Visualizes the correlation between numerical features to identify strong or weak relationships.

## 📈 Visual Insights & Components:

### ✅ Data Distribution
Generates histograms to showcase the distribution of key numerical variables, helping to detect skewness or imbalances.

### 📊 Outliers Detection
Box plots provide a visual representation of potential outliers, assisting in further data cleaning or investigation.

### 🔗 Variable Relationships
Scatter plots help visualize potential relationships between pairs of continuous variables, allowing for easier identification of trends and correlations.

### 🔍 Correlation Insights
A correlation matrix displays pairwise correlations between numerical variables, making it easier to spot highly correlated features.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

This script was built using the following tools and technologies:

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook / Script)** → Core language for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Matplotlib** → Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn** → Built on top of Matplotlib, used for making statistical plots like box plots and pair plots.
- **Pandas** → For data loading, manipulation, and preliminary statistics.
